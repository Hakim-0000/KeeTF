note to self:

I setup an internal gitea instance to start using IaC for this server. It's at a quite basic state, but I'm putting the password here because I will definitely forget.
This file isn't easy to find anyway unless you have the correct url...

gitea: port 3000
user: samarium
password: TUmhyZ37CLZrhP

ansible runner (olivetin): port 1337
